# Introduction / Background
Lending Club is an online P2P (peer-to-peer) lending platform that connects borrowers and investors, offering personal loan services. The business logic of Lending Club primarily involves three parties: borrowers, investors (or lenders), and the platform itself. Below is an overview of their respective roles and interactions:

- Borrowers
  
Role and Needs: Borrowers are typically individuals seeking personal loans, which they may need for various purposes such as debt consolidation, home improvement, medical expenses, or other personal expenditures.

Process:
Borrowers submit a loan application through the Lending Club platform, providing necessary personal and financial information.
The platform uses an internal credit assessment system to evaluate the borrowerâ€™s risk, assigning a credit rating and corresponding interest rate.
Once the loan is approved, borrowers can receive the funds through the platform and are required to repay the loan principal and interest according to the agreed schedule.

- Investors (Lenders)
Role and Needs: Investors are individuals or institutions looking to earn returns by providing funds to borrowers.

Process:
Investors can browse different loan projects on the Lending Club platform, which have been applied for by borrowers and approved by the platform.
Based on the borrower's credit rating, interest rate, and other information, investors can choose to invest in multiple borrower projects to diversify their risk.
Investors earn returns by collecting interest payments from borrowers.

- Lending Club Platform
Role and Function: Lending Club acts as an intermediary platform, primarily responsible for connecting borrowers with investors and providing related services.

Functions:
Risk Assessment and Credit Rating: The platform uses big data and machine learning algorithms to assess borrowers' creditworthiness and assign appropriate credit ratings.
Matching Transactions: The platform facilitates transactions between borrowers and investors, ensuring the liquidity and security of funds.
Fee Collection: Lending Club charges service fees from both borrowers and investors, which serve as its revenue source.

- Summary
  
Lending Club creates a win-win situation by offering a convenient lending channel for borrowers and investment opportunities for investors. Borrowers obtain the funds they need, while investors earn potential high returns through lending. The platform plays a crucial intermediary role in ensuring smooth transactions and earns profits from the fees charged.
